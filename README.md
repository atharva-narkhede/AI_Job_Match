## ⚙️ Project Setup

### 📦 Backend (Express + MongoDB)

```bash
cd server
npm install
````

Create a `.env` file in `server/` with the following:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ai_job
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_api_key
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

Run the backend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 💻 Frontend (React + Tailwind + Vite)

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Tailwind is configured via `postcss.config.cjs` and `tailwind.config.js`.

## 🧠 AI Matching Logic

We use **Cohere’s `embed-english-v3.0` model** to semantically match users to job descriptions using cosine similarity.

### Prompt Design

A user profile is formatted like this:

```
Skills: React, Node.js, AWS. Experience: 3 years. Preferences: Remote only.
```

This string is embedded and compared with all job embeddings. The top 3 results are returned as recommendations.

## ⚖️ Assumptions & Trade-Offs

* Matching is synchronous for simplicity
* Cookie-based auth for frontend compatibility
* No resume uploads — relies on structured profile input
* Admin dashboard not included (manual job creation)
* No pagination — assumes small dataset
* May experience cold starts if deployed on free-tier hosts
